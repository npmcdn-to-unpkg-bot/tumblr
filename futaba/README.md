# futaba

*futaba* is a simple grid-based gallery theme for Tumblr, powered by [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/) and optimized by [Infinity.js](http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/).

This theme is written using HTML5, CSS3, JS (with jQuery), and Tumblr semantics.

Warning: This is a tailored theme that only displays Photo and Photoset posts.

## Features

**Theme Options**
* *Logo*

  Your preferred image, centered at the top of the page.
* *Default Font*

  The font-family of the entire page, used mostly for post text on permalink pages.
* *Navigation Font*
  
  The distinct font-family for the navigation links on the page.
* *Note Count Font*

  The distinct font-family for the note count that is revealed when the cursor is hovering over a post.
  
**Responsive Layout**

This theme utilizes CSS3 media queries and responds to changes in window width. This will change the number of columns in the grid (maximum of 3 columns) and scale graphical elements accordingly.

**Infinite Scroll**

Pagination is performed via AJAX. Pagination also registers a URL change by pushing history states, to give users more control over their browsing.

**Insert Links**

Insert new links into the navigation row by adding Tumblr pages to your blog (two links have hard-coded positions: *ask* is first and *archive* is last).

**Post Overlays**

Hovering over posts with the mouse cursor reveals a semi-transparent black overlay with the number of the post's notes.

**Quick Ask**

Clicking on the *ask* link will reveal an ask box centered on the page.

## Discontinued

I am no longer interested in updating this theme.
